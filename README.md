# Genpact-Machine-Learning-Hackathon---DataHack---Analytics-Vidhya

I recently paricipated in this Hackathon, this was my first hackthon I was at 307 position with 764 total competitors. It was my first experience of Machine Learning hackthon and i loved it but I am not satisfies with my rank I will keep learning more and reach to the top.
This Respository contains Dataset along with my various submission of the codes. I don't wish to indulge in any malicious activities by posting the Dataset here i just wish to help fellow people who didn't get the chance to compete in the competition.I Have downloaded all my submissions files in the order I have submitted them and in the bracket I have written the loss/error I got in each submission.
